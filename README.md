This code combines FastAPI, React, and machine learning to create a simple web application.

Here's how the application works:
1. The user visits the web application, which displays an interface for uploading images.
2. The user selects an image and uploads it through the frontend.
3. The frontend sends the uploaded image to the FastAPI backend.
4. The FastAPI backend preprocesses the image and uses the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to classify it.
5. The backend sends the classification result back to the frontend.
6. The frontend displays the classification result to the user.
